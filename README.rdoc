= flatten2

This plugin provides Array#flatten2, my own implementation of the standard #flatten method.

To test it out install the gem, then run the following in your Ruby script or in irb:

  require 'rubygems'
  gem 'flatten2'
  require 'flatten2'

This will give you the Array#flatten2 method.  You can also run the specs to confirm that it is working correctly.
